    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="intro">
        Hi, I'm Vin√≠cius Iancovski, a 24-year-old full stack developer from Brazil.
    </p>

    <p [ngClass]="{'fade': !expanded}">
        While still in high school, I had the opportunity to participate in a programming training program,
        where I discovered my passion for problem-solving and building innovative solutions.
        This led me to pursue a degree in software engineering, and start my career as a developer.

                I'm driven by a commitment to excellence and simplicity. I believe in doing things right
                without overcomplicating the process. My goal is to always create efficient and scalable
                solutions that stand the test of time.
                <br><br>
                Today I am working and continuously learning, particularly in programming and English,
                with a strong interest in expanding my expertise as an autodidact.
                <br><br>
                My dream is to start a new life in Europe, and I'm currently in the process of obtaining
                Italian citizenship to help make that dream a reality. I enjoy traveling, hiking, and
                outdoor activities that keep me connected to nature.
